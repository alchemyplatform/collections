docs {
  The alchemy_pendingTransactions subscribes to pending transactions and filters those transactions based on specified from and/or to addresses. both fromAddress and toAddress properties in the params object of the message can be a single address or an array of addresses.
  
  The subscription will return either full transaction objects or just transaction hashes depending on the request.
